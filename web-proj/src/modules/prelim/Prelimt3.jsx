                            While in Crete Daedalus created the plan for the Minoan Palace of Knossos, one of the most important
                            archaeological sites in Crete and Greece today. It was a magnificent architectural design and building,
                            of 1,300 rooms, decorated with stunning frescoes and artifacts, saved until today.

                            King Minos and Daedalus had great understanding at first, but their relationships started deteriorating.
                            The most common explanation is that Daedalus advised Princess Ariadne to give Theseus the thread that
                            helped him escape the Labyrinth after killing the Minotaur.

                            Imprisoned in the Labyrinth, Daedalus created wings from branches of osier and wax. He taught Icarus
                            how to fly but warned him not to fly too close to the sun. Their flight was the first time man managed
                            to fight the laws of nature and beat gravity.

                            Icarus, excited by flying, ignored his father's warnings. His wings melted when he flew too close to
                            the sun, and he fell into the sea. The Icarian Sea was named after him.
